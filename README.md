# EaseMyTrip-clone
This is a clone of EaseMyTrip.com

It is a trip booking website and we have tried to clone its **Flight Search** fuctionality.


We have use **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, **Express**, **MongoDB**, and **Mongoose** in this project.


Our project is not resposive but fit to all desktop and laptop screen.


## Index.html
**Index.html** is our entry point.
We have tried to make our home page exact similar to the original one.

-On the home page user can register and login at the same time if comming on the page first time.
for that he or she has to enter his or her login id.
